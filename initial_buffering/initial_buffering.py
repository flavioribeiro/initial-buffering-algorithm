# You have a HLS stream with content at just 1 bitrate. This content has been encoded in
# a VBR fashion leading to different segments having different sizes. If we knew the 
# following data prior to playback at the client - exact size of each segment in the content, 
# exact bandwidth of the channel(assume the bandwidth does not vary with time), duration of 
# content and of each segment - how would we determine a fixed initial buffering delay at the 
# client such that once we start the playback there is no buffering pause. Assume that the client
# has sufficient buffer memory to store the entire content, if required.
